ZSI, the Zolera SOAP Infrastructure, is a pure-Python module that
provides an implementation of SOAP messaging, as described in The
SOAP 1.1 Specification (see http://www.w3.org/TR/soap).  It can also
be used to build applications using SOAP Messages with Attachments.
(see http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP-attachments) ZSI is intended to make it
easier to write web services in Python.

In particular, ZSI parses and generates SOAP messages, and converts
between native Python datatypes and SOAP syntax. Simple dispatch and
invocation methods are supported.  There are no known bugs.  It's only
known limitation is that it cannot handle multi-dimensional arrays.

ZSI is built on top of DOM.  It requires Python 2.0 or later, and PyXML
0.6 or later.  It is open source.  We hope you find it useful.

The documentation (in PDF and HTML) is accurate. We should probably
restructure the document as a HOWTO.  You probably can't usefully
edit the docs without having the Python2.0 sources and some other
utilities (TeX, pdfLaTeX, latex2html) on a Unix box.  If you do,
then edit doc/Makefile to point to your distribution.

Things to be done -- any volunteers?

Use isinstance() for types.

Use is/is not for singletons (None, [] (,) '' etc)

Update to SOAPv1.2
