2004-02-17 23:36  warnes

	* tests/SOAPtest.py: Fix a change to how SOAPpy returns namespace
	  URI's that are non-string.  They used to be converted to strings
	  and now are not.  I'm not entirely sure what the correct behavior
	  is...

2004-02-17 23:28  warnes

	* SOAPpy/Types.py: Accept provosed revision by Ivan Judson to the
	  handling of faultType objects in simplify().

2004-02-17 23:25  warnes

	* SOAPpy/version.py: Update version number for 0.11.3 release.

	* docs/GettingStarted.txt: Add \n to end of file.

2004-02-17 23:16  warnes

	* tests/testClient1.py: Add test of echo with named parameter in
	  call to catch bugs related to providing names.

2004-02-17 23:15  warnes

	* SOAPpy/SOAPBuilder.py: Fix bug #875977: no escaping of bad
	  tagnames for NoneTypes.  Both bug and fix suggested by Robert
	  Zimmermann.

2004-02-17 23:10  warnes

	* SOAPpy/SOAPBuilder.py: Apply patch to fix bug #888345: Python 2.3
	  boolean type serialized as int, both provided by Nelson Minar.

2004-02-17 23:05  warnes

	* SOAPpy/Client.py: Nelson Minar reported bug 888352 and provided a
	  patch:

	      If the server does not send a content-length header for the
	      response, SOAPpy's Client fails to read the response. The
	  Google
	      Web APIs at api.google.com are one such service, as of around
	      2004-01-20.

	      A patch is included below to just read the whole socket's
	  contents
	      if there is no content-length. This should work fine for
	  HTTP/1.0,
	      but will cause troubles with HTTP/1.1 and chunked
	      encoding. SOAPpy's Client.py uses an old HTTP compatibility
	  class
	      from httplib which sends 1.0 requests, so this seems safe.

2004-02-13 14:04  irjudson

	* SOAPpy/Types.py: I've added a SOAPException(Exception) class. The
	  simplify_objects option now raises a SOAPException instead of a
	  faultType. This seems to make more sense to me, but I could be
	  wrong.

2004-02-13 14:02  irjudson

	* tests/echoClient.py: Added another missing call.

2004-02-03 22:21  irjudson

	* SOAPpy/GSIServer.py: Modified GSIServer to have a GSIConfig that
	  handles the pyGlobus specific configuartion details. Hides this
	  from users.

2004-02-03 01:39  irjudson

	* docs/GlobusSupport.txt: Updated for simpler client usage.

2004-02-03 01:38  irjudson

	* SOAPpy/Server.py: Added a fix for exception handling that cleans
	  up exception data structures. This plugs a memory leak when
	  exceptions are raised.

2004-02-03 01:21  irjudson

	* tests/echoServer.py: Added Context Test, cleaned up output to
	  honor Config.debug flag more.

2004-02-03 01:20  irjudson

	* tests/echoClient.py: Cleaned up client usage of globus, added in
	  simplest test.

2004-02-03 01:11  irjudson

	* SOAPpy/Client.py: Changed the use of SOAPAction, it used to
	  default to setting it to "", now it defaults to setting it to the
	  method (not the nsmethod). There is a clause in Server.py that
	  catches 'old style' SOAPActions (aka "") and sets them to the
	  method. When this is confirmed to be what everyone wants and we
	  decide it's alright to (possibly) break client/server interop, we
	  can take the clause out of Server.py and just handle SOAPActions
	  of "" as a possible error/warning.

2004-02-03 01:08  irjudson

	* SOAPpy/GSIServer.py: Turned off default logging.

2004-02-03 01:08  irjudson

	* SOAPpy/Server.py: Added context handling. Each call builds a SOAP
	  context and puts it in the global dict _contexts (indexed by
	  thread id).  There is also a new function: GetSOAPContext() that
	  returns the context for the current thread.  Removed previously
	  added method keyword args,.  Turned off default log = 1 in
	  RequestHandler Classes.

2004-01-30 23:20  warnes

	* SOAPpy/: Client.py, Config.py, Errors.py, GSIServer.py, NS.py,
	  Parser.py, SOAP.py, SOAPBuilder.py, Server.py, Types.py,

	  made changes having to do with moving of ZSI-specific material to
	  zsi/test/wsdlpy, removed dependencies on utils.py.

2004-01-26 01:35  dwrobertson

	  Added GlobusSupport.txt documentation submitted by Ivan R. Judson
	  <judson@mcs.anl.gov>.

2004-01-15 00:39  warnes

	* tests/testClient1.py:
	  Add test for dataTimeType objects.

2004-01-15 00:34  warnes

	* SOAPpy/Server.py, tests/echoServer.py:
	  Integrate patch from Ivan R. Judson [mailto:judson@mcs.anl.gov]:

	      "There's a namespace collision in the Server.py module for
	      deciding what namespace should be used, ie, r._ns or the
	      path. I've resolved it with a big comment that basically
	  says,
	      r._ns is the preferred specification, but that if it is
	  missing
	      and self.path exists, use that.

	      "This patch also includes the previous patch to include
	  "method" :
	      nsmethod in the keywords for invocations so that
	  authorization
	      gets the methodname."

2004-01-05 13:03  warnes

	* SOAPpy/Types.py:
	  - Code assumes nested scopes, so I added the proper import so
	  this	 will work under python 2.2.x

	  - _setAttr was assuming that all attributes are strings. Fixed.

2004-01-01 23:17  rsalz

	* SOAPpy/SOAPBuilder.py:
	  - Fixed bug [ 792258 ] "SOAPBuilder.SOAPBuilder.dump can catch
	  wrong   exceptions" in SOAPBuilder.dump() submitted by Greg
	  Chapman (glchapman).

	  - Fixed a bug in SOAPBuilder.dump_instance() that had been masked
	  by   bug #792258.

2003-12-23 04:24  warnes

	* tests/SOAPtest.py:
	  - Add call to structType.__init__ for user classes that inherit
	  from	 structType.  This fixes a bug in the tests that was masked
	  by   incorrectly catching & ignoring exceptions in
	  SOAPBuilder.dump().

2003-12-23 04:10  warnes

	* tests/testClient1.py:
	  - testClient1.py now works.  The problem was failing to set
	  'quit' back to zero	after the SOAP server exited.

2003-12-23 03:22  warnes

	* SOAPpy/SOAPBuilder.py:
	  - Remove call to gentag from 'dump' and add to 'dump_float', per
	  bug	report [ 792600 ] "SOAPBuilder.SOAPBuilder.dump possibly
	  should not   call gentag" by Greg Chapman (glchapman).

2003-12-23 03:21  warnes

	  - Fix syntax error from last change.

2003-12-23 02:42  warnes

	* SOAPpy/wstools/WSDLTools.py:
	  - Added 'strict' option to the WSDL class. If strict is true, a
	  RuntimeException will be raised if an unrecogned message is
	  recieved.  If strict is false, a warning will be printed to the
	  console, the message type will be added to the WSDL schema, and
	  processing will continue.  This is in response to the second half
	  of   bug report [ 817331 ] "Some WSDL.py changes", submitted by
	  Rudolf   Ruland.

2003-12-23 02:21  warnes

	* SOAPpy/Client.py, SOAPpy/Parser.py, SOAPpy/SOAPBuilder.py,
	  tests/SOAPtest.py, tests/simpleWSDL.py:
	  - Updated calls to fpconst - SOAPpy now checks for nonstandard
	  infinity encoding produced by some older SOAP tools like SOAP4J
	  and	Apache SOAP (both now superceeded by Axis SOAP).

	  - Added the offending XML string to the exception thrown when a
	  float/double underflow or overflow occurs.

	  - Minor twiddles in the examples.

2003-12-19 13:22  warnes

	* SOAPpy/: Client.py, Config.py, Types.py:
	  - Modified SOAPProxy code to correctly pull value of
	  unwrap_results   and simplify_objects from Config unless
	  specifically provided in the	 instantiation call.

	  - Modified Config to better handle configuration variables that
	  are	only valid when pyGlobus is available.

	  - Added more documentation to Config variables.

	  - Better documentation for simplify() and simplify_contents()
	  functions.

2003-12-19 13:16  warnes

	* tests/: README, SOAPtest.py, echoClient.py, echoHeader.py,

	* SOAPpy/: Config.py, Parser.py, SOAPBuilder.py, Server.py,
	  Types.py:

	  - Config.unwrap_results now works properly.

	  - New Config.dict_encoding option to control the encoding of
	  dictionary keys.    By default this is 'ascii' so that
	  dictionaries have ordinary string    keys even if they were
	  encoded into UTF for transport (the default	 is UTF-8).  Any
	  other encoding known to string.encode is valid.

	  - New Config.strict_range option to force Parsing to enforce
	  range   checking on  double and float variables.  This is off by
	  default.

2003-12-18 01:31  warnes

	* tests/: SOAPtest.py, TCtest.py, echoClient.py, echoServer.py,
	  quoteTest.py, storageTest.py, xmethods.py:

	  - Modified SOAPtest.py to work when Config.unwrap_results=1.	-

	  information in echoClient.py,   echoServer.py, storageTest.py -
	  Removed unneeded import from quoteTest.py that was generating a

	  xmethods.py

2003-12-18 01:23  warnes

	* tests/README:

	  - A little documentation can go a long way, ;^)

2003-12-17 17:18  warnes

2003-12-08 03:04  boverhof

	* SOAPpy/wstools/WSDLTools.py:
	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	   Modified Files:
		  WSDLTools.py -- partial bug fix for [ 850905 ] wsdl2py
	  crash on a more sophisticated WSDL.
		      We do expect a list, but nmtokens is a list separated
	  by a single space.  So if
		      "parts" is a string, the just split it to create a
	  list.

	* SOAPpy/wstools/XMLSchema.py:
	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	   Modified Files:
		  XMLSchema.py -- error in Import class for accessing a
	  schemaLocation.
		      This bug would only show up if a schema had to
	  'construct' a

	  Basically the

	* tests/SOAPtest.py:
	  - Fix some errors - Updated to mactch change back to "v#" unnamed
	  variable naming strategy.  - Added config.unwrap=0 to prevent

2003-11-14 13:48  warnes

	* SOAPpy/Types.py:
	  - Modify compoundType to remove internal _asdict and _aslist
	  objects   which were different views of (some of) the object
	  attributes.  It   was possible for these views to get out of sync
	  causing (at least)   confusion.  Instead, I provide _aslist() and
	  _asdict() functions to   render the existing data in the desired
	  format.

	  - Modify simplify() function to work recursively on compound
	  types.

2003-11-14 13:44  warnes

	* SOAPpy/Server.py: - if Config.unwrap_results is True, convert
	  SOAPpy arrayType and	 structType to python list and dictionary.

	  ordered   arguments.

2003-11-14 13:36  warnes

	* SOAPpy/SOAPBuilder.py: - Modifid to use "v[0-9]+" as pattern for
	  ordered but unnamed	parameters instead of "_[0-9]".  - Modified
	  dump_instance to simplify writing out object components.

2003-11-14 13:32  warnes

	* SOAPpy/Parser.py: - Parser.py now converts arrayType and
	  structType SOAPpy objects to	 standard python lists and
	  dictionaries when Config.unwrap_results is   True.

2003-11-14 13:29  warnes

	* SOAPpy/Config.py: - Changed config.specialArgs back to a simple
	  flag.

	  > I've been using your SOAPpy library (version 0.10.3) in an
	  application
	  > I've been developing, and have had complaints about the amount
	  of time
	  > it takes to receive large packets of data.	In this
	  application, the
	  > server was sending through PDF documents as base64-encoded
	  strings,
	  > which were transmitted using a perl SOAP library, and processed
	  on my
	  > end using SOAPpy.  As soon as the PDF files got reasonably
	  large,
	  > SOAPpy was taking a long time to decode the data -- up to five
	  minutes
	  > in some cases.
	  >
	  > I started digging into the SOAPpy source code, and quickly
	  found the
	  > cause of the problem: the Parser.py module was using a Python
	  string
	  > to store the character data, and as new character data was
	  being
	  > received, it was "appending" the new data like this [from
	  Parser.py,
	  > line 404]:
	  >
	  >	  self._data += c
	  >
	  > The problem with this is that Python strings are immutable, so
	  the
	  > above statement is actually recreating the entire string buffer
	  from
	  > scratch every time a new line of character data is received --
	  which
	  > is extremely inefficient.  A much better way to do this is to
	  use a
	  > (mutable) Python list object, and to append the new character
	  data to
	  > the end of this list, like this:
	  >
	  >	  self._data = []
	  >
	  >	  ...
	  >
	  >	  self._data.append(c)
	  >
	  > and then use:
	  >
	  >	  string.join(self._data, "")
	  >
	  > to obtain the complete copy of the list once all the lines of
	  data
	  > have been processed.  I've attached a unified diff file listing
	  the
	  > changes I've made to Parser.py to implement this -- they're
	  pretty
	  > minimal, and won't affect anything other than the performance
	  of
	  > character data processing.
	  >
	  > The results of this patch are quite impressive: I tried
	  processing a
	  > SOAP response with a single string containing around 675K of
	  data.
	  > Using the unpatched Parser.py file, it took 111 seconds to
	  process --
	  > with this patch, it took just 2.4 seconds.
	  >
	  > I hope you find this useful...
	  >
	  > Cheers,

	  > PS: Thanks for the work you (and the others) are doing on
	  SOAPpy.
	  > It's a great library!

	* SOAPpy/: version.py, wstools/UserTuple.py, wstools/XMLSchema.py:

	  - Modified XMLSchema to extend UserTuple instead of tuple for
	  python < 2.2.

	  - Added UserTuple class, taken from from Stefan Schwarzer's
	  ftputil   library, which is available at

2003-07-18 11:58  warnes

	* SOAPpy/URLopener.py, SOAPpy/WSDL.py, tests/BabelfishWSDLTest.py:
	  - Modifed WSDL.Proxy to pass along all arguments to SOAPProxy.
	  This	 should ensure that all features of SOAPProxy are
	  accessible to users	of WSDL.Proxy

	  - Created URLopener.py, which contains a class extending
	  urllib.FancyURLopener.  This class allows reading from URLs that
	   are protected by basic authenticatoin, have been relocated, etc.

	  - Modified WSDL.Proxy to use URLopener.  It should now permit
	  access   to WSDL files protected by basic authentication.

2003-07-17 17:48  boverhof

	* SOAPpy/wstools/: WSDLTools.py, XMLSchema.py:	Modified Files:
		  WSDLTools.py -- just a few minor changes so the new
	  schema class
			  will be used instead of the schema tns
	  placeholder.

			  Might want to add an argument to WSDL.load method
	  so that
			  programmer can specify the placeholder or actual
			  implementation.

		  XMLSchema.py -- mostly new, unused original code is
	  commented out at the bottom.

2003-07-02 14:58  warnes

	* SOAPpy/: Client.py, version.py:
	  - Client.py failed to import faultType from Types.py, and was
	  getting   the python default instead.  This caused problems in
	  properly   detecting errors on the server reported via SOAP.

2003-05-29 17:01  warnes

	* SOAPpy/WSDL.py:
	  - Add additional arguments to __init__ which will be passed to
	  Proxy.__init__.  This allows specification of proxy server and

2003-05-22 22:31  feanor420

	* SOAPpy/wstools/Utility.py: Running pychecker over ZSI, and I
	  noticed some problems in wstools.

	  I fixed that fact that Notation and Entity were not be found. I
	  changed them to use the qualified name like the rest of the
	  symbols from xml.dom.minidom.

	  I also discovered that a RecursionError was being thrown, but
	  RecursionError didn't exist. I created simple sub-class of
	  Exception to rectify this.

2003-05-21 13:39  warnes

	* SOAPpy/Client.py:
	  - Modified getNS pattern to prevent grabbing to much text.

2003-05-21 12:06  blunck2

	* SOAPpy/Client.py: changed namespace regular expression so that it
	  matches what is returned from a stateful (*shiver*) soap server.
	  for example, the namespace returned from a stateful soap server
	  looks like:  urn:echo@rO0ABXNyACJ3ZWJsb2....	where urn:echo was
	  the original namespace.

	  - Added file 'version.py' whose sole purpose is to hold the
	  definition   of __version__ in a single place.  - Modified
	  Server.py and Client.py to 'from version import __version__'.  -
	  Removed __version__ definition from Error.py, which never used
	  it.

2003-05-08 13:26  rsalz

	* SOAPpy/: WSDL.py, wstools/ServiceProxy.py, wstools/__init__.py:
	  Finish up what Mark Bucciarelli kicked off and I started with
	  commit a little while ago. :)  That is, wstools is now
	  independant of SOAPpy and ZSI.  This commit does the following:
	  wstools/ServiceProxy.py is now ZSI/ServiceProxy.py, so some
	  imports and ZSI docs had to change.  ZSI needs some changing, in
	  case I didn't patch up all the imports right.

2003-05-08 12:58  rsalz

	* SOAPpy/wstools/: ServiceProxy.py, WSDLTools.py: Move some stuff
	  from ServiceProxy (which imports ZSI) to WSDLTools (which
	  doesn't), so that SOAPpy can use wstools without needing ZSI
	  around...  which is kinda the point of generic common-code. :)

	      class SOAPCallInfo:
	      class ParameterInfo:
	      class HeaderInfo(ParameterInfo):
	      def callInfoFromWSDL(port, name):
	  Next step is to move what's left of wstools/ServiceProxy.py into
	  the ZSI module (and fix up the imports), so that wstools has *no*
	  soap-stack-specific code in it.

2003-05-07 17:07  warnes

	* SOAPpy/SOAP.py:
	  - Fixed XML parse error memory leak fix to still raise the
	  error...

2003-05-07 12:50  warnes

	* SOAPpy/SOAP.py:
	  - Applied patch by bstpierre, which he suggested to fix memory
	  leaks   in bug report 544572 (see
	  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=544572&group_id=26590&atid=387667).
	  The leaks seem to have been corrected by other patches, but
	  the	 suggested code is cleaner, so I've applied it anyway.

2003-05-07 11:34  warnes

	* SOAPpy/SOAP.py:

	  return the value from the __call invocation (there was previously
	  no way to extract the return values from the call)

2002-07-30 22:28  blunck2

	* SOAPpy/SOAP.py: HTTPTransport.call(..) returns the response
	  message from the HTTP request regardless of the value of

	  getNS, the data is guaranteed to be there.

	  included.(Brad Knotwell)

2002-07-25 17:38  blunck2

	  SOAPProxy that calls __call (not sure   if it is necessary - feel
	  free to remove if you want)

2002-07-25 15:43  warnes

	* SOAPpy/SOAP.py:
	  - Patch from Brad Knotwell [b.knotwell@f5.com] to add basic
	  authentication:

	       Hi Gregory--

	       This is untested (except for running some of the example
	  programs
	       to ensure it didn't break anything).  However, it's trivial
	       enough (and copied almost verbatim from ZSI. . .I helped
	  Rich
	       with Authorization there as well) that I would be pretty
	       confident about committing it.  My primary assumption in
	  saying
	       this is that the Authorization header can show up *anywhere*
	  in
	       the header stream and that I've inserted the putheader in
	  the
	       right method call.

	       --Brad

2002-05-24 17:38  warnes

	* SOAPpy/SOAP.py:
	  Fixes to enble proper handling of SOAP faults by the client.

	  - Fixed test of whether message content is text/xml when
	  recieving a fault.  - Added __call__ method to exception classes
	  to match the current API.  - The faultType.__repr__() method now
	  print details if present

2002-05-10 10:56  warnes

	* SOAPpy/: SOAP.py, XMLname.py, __init__.py:
	  - Added XMLnam.py which provides toXMLname() and fromXMLname()
	  for	properly encoding xml tag names per the SOAP 2.1 (draft)
	  specification.

	  - Added calls to toXMLname() and fromXMLname() so that tags names
	  are	properly encoded.  This resolves bug [ 548785 ] 'Error
	  passing dict	 keys containing space.'

	  - Added code to cgi encode contents of tags when they are not a
	  recognized type.  Fixes bug [ 549551 ] 'Error when passing
	  non-standard types'.

	  - Added __init__.py, so that SOAPpy can be used like a standard
	  python   module.
